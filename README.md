.Introduction
Electrical and electronic circuits are fundamental components of modern engineering systems, as they are used in a wide range of applications such as power systems, communication devices, and control systems. The behavior of these circuits depends on the characteristics of their components and the way they interact with electrical signals. A solid understanding of basic circuit elements is therefore essential for analyzing and designing reliable electronic systems.

Resistors, inductors, and capacitors are the primary passive components used in circuit design. A resistor controls the flow of current and dissipates electrical energy in the form of heat, while an inductor and a capacitor store energy in magnetic and electric fields, respectively. Each component responds differently to changes in voltage and current, especially when alternating signals are applied. This frequency-dependent behavior plays an important role in determining the overall performance of electrical circuits.

When these components are combined in a single circuit, their interaction produces more complex electrical behavior. The total impedance of the circuit varies with frequency, affecting the magnitude and phase of the current. Analyzing such circuits allows engineers to predict voltage and current relationships and evaluate circuit performance under different operating conditions. This analysis is crucial in many practical applications where stable and predictable operation is required.

This report presents a detailed theoretical and practical study of circuits containing resistive, inductive, and capacitive elements. The fundamental principles governing each component are discussed, followed by an analysis of their combined behavior in an RLC circuit. Calculations and simulations are used to support the theoretical analysis and to demonstrate the validity of the results obtained.
